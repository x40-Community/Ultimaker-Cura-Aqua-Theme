## Install
The installation is very easy. Pack the zip archive and copy the Aqua directory to Cura's themes directory. If there is no themes directory in the resources directory, create one and then copy the aqua directory into it.

Look for the resources directory on your PC from your Cura installation:

    Windows
    Cura 5.X (C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 5.0.0\share\cura\resources)

    Linux
    /usr/share/cura/resources
    ~/.local/share/cura/5.1/resources


    MacOS (In Finder go to the application folder, find Cura 5.1, right click in the application, open show contents, contents, MacOS, resources)

 

Now start Cura and under Preferences -> configure Cura... select the General tab and then the "Aqua" theme. Close the dialog box and restart Cura for the Aqua theme to appear.
